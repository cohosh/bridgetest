[SITENAME] is an arbitrary identifier for the probe site
that you have to choose.

[TYPE] is the type of probe test to be performed. Right not
there is only one type: 'obfs4'.

The bridge_lines.txt file should contain a list of bridges to test. Each line corresponds to a bridge and should be of the form:
        <nickname>,<bridge_line>
where <bridge_line> is the line to go in the torrc file and is structured as follows:
        obfs4 <IP:Port> <FINGERPRINT> cert=<CERT> iat-mode=0

Add to crontab to run tests 4x a day:
	0 */6 * * * cd ~/bridgetest && ./probetest.sh [TYPE] [SITENAME]

Generate a CSV file from logs:
	find log -name '*.log' | sort | ./makecsv > obfs4test.csv

Make a graph:
	Rscript graph.R obfs4test.csv
