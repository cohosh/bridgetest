[SITENAME] is an arbitrary identifier for the probe site
that you have to choose.

[TYPE] is the type of probe test to be performed. Right not
there is only one type: 'obfs4'.

The bridge_lines.txt file should contain a list of bridges to test. Each line corresponds to a bridge and should be of the form:
        <nickname>,<bridge_line>
where <bridge_line> is the line to go in the torrc file and is structured as follows:
        obfs4 <IP:Port> <FINGERPRINT> cert=<CERT> iat-mode=0

Add to crontab to run tests 4x a day:
	0 */6 * * * cd ~/bridgetest && ./probetest.sh [TYPE] [SITENAME]

Analyze Tor bootstrap progress from logs:
	1. Make the CSV: find log -name '*.log' | sort | ./makecsv > bootstrap.csv
	2. Plot the results: Rscript graph.R bootstrap.csv

Analyze obfs4 throughput from pcap files:
    1. Adapt the variables CLIENT_TUPLE and SERVER_TUPLE in infer-throughput.py.
    2. Run the script: python infer-throughput.py download.pcap > download.csv
    3. Plot the results: Rscript plot-throughput.R download.csv    

Analyze snowflake throughput from pcap files:
    1. Adapt the LOG_PATH variable in snowflake-throughput.py
    2. Run the script: python snowflake-throughput.py > download.csv
    3. Plot the results: Rscript snowflake-throughput.R download.csv
